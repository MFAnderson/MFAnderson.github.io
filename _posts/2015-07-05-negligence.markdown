title: Negligence, News & Nattering

Perhaps the real reason I didn't spin up a blog sooner is 
that I'm terrible at committing my thoughts to words. 
At this point I have 3 draft articles sitting in my local 
repo and I hate them all and never want them to see the 
light of day. I do however need to commit a CSS change, 
because Open Sans' lack of glyph for any of the schwa 
codepoints makes the title look wrong in a way that makes 
me very sad. Since I'm doing that, I figured I might as well 
document my very exciting life progress!

After a short stint at a previous client automating some 
incredibly unnecessary manual processes (literally 
copy-pasting old SQL scripts, changing variables and 
manually running them against the production DB) 
I've moved to a brand new project with a new client 
doing what will hopefully be some super impactful work 
improving their release process. As a result I am finally 
getting around to reading [Continuous Delivery][cd], 
as well as learning some Ansible and how to use [Go CD][go] 
effectively. With any luck this will turn into some 
actually meaningful thoughts that I can write down, 
since janitoring user input as you drop it into a DB
was perhaps unsurprisingly not a rich source of 
technical insights. In particular we'll see if I 
can't use a blog post to help clarify my feelings on
Ansible vs. Chef once I've got a bit more Ansible 
experience under my belt.

Also exciting is that this new project is considerably 
more consulting-y and less staff-aug than the last 2.
We've been brought in to actually change things, so 
we should have a bit more freedom to suggest improvements 
to broader processes (and will need to if any meaningful 
changes to the release process are going to happen).
