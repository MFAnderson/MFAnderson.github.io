title: On Motivation, Inspiration, and Self-Fulfillment
---

2015 was a good year, all told. It got off to an extremely rough start at an interpersonal level but had a
steady upwards trajectory. I wrapped up a project, built enough of a reputation to be asked back for another
project with the same client, got involved more in the operational side of our business, helped start a new
client relationship where I play a fairly central role, and met someone who has had a fairly profound impact
on my world view (more on that later). But when I look at my 'accomplishments' in 2015, I'm struck by the
profound lack of intentionality that underlies them all. They are each the product of just showing up and
maybe letting my brain loose on what comes my way. In the past this wouldn't have bothered me as it's frankly
representative of my life up until now, yet I now find it profoundly unsatisfying.

To the best of my ability to analyze this, I suspect it to be the result of the world view shift.
When I met this person, who I'll call Matt to protect the innocent, I don't think I could have imagined that they
would change my thinking about who I am and how I live my life to the extent that they have. Matt is, in a word,
electric; a supercharged bundle of energy whose eyes spark with furious determination to _do more_. Matt is the
person who sets new year's resolutions and actually meets them; the person who fits more _stuff_ into
some days than most people I know fit into a week; the person who, despite all this, still finds time to worry
about not doing enough. 

Matt has never chastised me for being lazy, nor for not doing enough, but I've started assessing what I'm
actually _doing_ with my life. I like my job and I do good work, but outside of that? Sure maybe once a month I'll
find a loose morsel of inspiration and spend a couple of hours writing or coding, but it's pretty scant
beyond that and I do not work nearly enough to justify the absence of 'doing' in the remaining 128 hours of the
week. Instead I find myself burning time; a staggering amount of time is spent watching TV, playing games,
or just idly wasting hours. When people ask me if I'm happy, I find that my answer has a strong negative
correlation with how much time I've been left to my own devices. I am, in short, failing at self-fulfillment.
As a result I'm thinking I want to do more with the time I have, not just in 2016 but from now on. Which is
where I hit the motivation hurdle.

I have a rocky history with motivation. On the whole I would say I have lived my life as a fairly unmotivated
person, but there have been (brief) periods of my life where I have accomplished things that absolutely required
a good deal of motivation, including losing 40lbs over the course of 8 months when I was 17/18. Unfortunately
I couldn't for the life of me tell you where that motivation came from, and attempts to retrieve it in the past
8 years have proved spectacularly unfruitful. However, I recently read an article online which, while not super
insightful, did draw a distinction between motivation and inspiration that resonated. It posits that motivation
is a long term, persistent drive arising from one's value system, while inspiration is evanescent, born from
external events and lasting only briefly. I don't fully buy into the exact delineation, but the differentiated
nature of short intense external inspiration and the slow, unwavering pulse of internal drive certainly strikes
a chord.

So now I'm left with the question of how to move forward. I can't continue as I've been doing, and it turns out
that all of my current strategies amount to precisely... well not nothing, but very little. What I do know is
that I need to understand the _why_ of the things I want to accomplish, and that I need to dismantle the notion
of waiting for the "perfect" time to begin. I need to be diligent about asking myself if what I'm doing is
actually satisfying, or just a way to fill time until someone lays satisfaction in front of me. I need to not
let myself off the hook for coasting through life, relying on my brainpower to satisfice. To that end I am
going to aim to write here considerably more frequently. This will require aggressive suppression of
my perfectionist tendencies, so there will probably be a lot of real stinkers as I attempt to contort my brain
into a new mode of operating. I'm just going to have to deal with that.

I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g) that my mother sent me when I was finishing 
university that I recall thinking was interesting but not particularly relevant to me. It's remarkable how
things change in 4 years.
