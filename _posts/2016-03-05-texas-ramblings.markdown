title: Ramblings from the desert
---

My aspirations of being less exacting with my self-censorship on this blog have so far
proven pretty anaemic. I've currently got 3 posts sitting half done in my local repo,
and no real sense of how to actually finish them and put them out. Instead I'm finding
myself starting yet another post, although this one is sufficiently ill-defined in
scope that I don't think I can self-sabotage into not pushing it out.

At the moment I'm sitting in the Phoenix airport attempting to get home and being stymied
by the Bay Area's complete inability to deal with any form of weather. Prior to this
I spent the past week sitting in an aluminum box in the middle of the desert - wind howling,
sun glaring, the whole to-do. More prosaically I was theoretically on vacation visiting my 
dad in Marfa, TX, though somehow I still managed to find myself on multiple calls for work.
If you're not familiar with Marfa, it's a very peculiar small town in the Chihuahuan desert,
about 180 miles from the nearest commercial airports, 60 miles north of the Rio Grande, and
surrounded by cattle ranches in most directions. It's also home to a thriving artist
community and hosts numerous galleries and several artistic foundations. 

I've been to Marfa 7 times now and I still find myself utterly unable to describe the place
in words; my only consolation is that many of the successful writers who come through the
Lannan Foundation's residency program appear equally at a loss to capture the essence of Marfa.
It's some combination of the small-town feel and the absolutely breathtaking landscape and
the fascinating intersection of people, but if David Foster Wallace can't express it then what
hope do I have? In any case, for me trips to Marfa are always a mix of inspiring, relaxing,
and delicious. The last part will only be true for you if you can get my dad to cook for you,
because he makes extremely tasty food. Like seriously, top-tier, mega gosu food. This latest
trip was no exception and I spent most of the evenings chatting away with a varied bunch of
writers, visual artists, and musicians (and also one honest-to-god Texan cowboy who dropped
by to drink tequila and watch the sunset).
