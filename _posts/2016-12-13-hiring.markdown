title: On Hiring For Diversity And Inclusion
---

It seems to be all the rage so I thought I would write a blog post 
on this topic.

## LOL @ u
maybe consider talking to a person who belongs to an underrepresented 
group in tech rather than my cishet white male ass.

### No seriously, lol @ u
No, not your one woman dev friend. She's got enough going on, try starting with 
one of the multitudes of people who have written _extensively_ on this topic. 
I'm sure you can google. I have faith.
